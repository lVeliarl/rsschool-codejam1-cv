      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p class="right">Hey there! Thanks for stopping by to visit my page. Think I should introduce myself to you, my name's Dzmitry, 22 years old. Since 1.5 months ago I've made a conscious decision to pursue a development career, I didn't really know what kind of developer, but i knew that's the way my life was going to move from there on. Why, you ask? Well, it's simple, really. After graduating, I couldn't really find myself and I really didn't feel like doing odd jobs for the rest of my life. I needed to strive for something in my life, because, as you know, stagnation is essentially death. The answer's been right under my nose this whole time. I've always been kind of a "nerd" at heart and good with computers in general. But I've always had this preconception, that in order to become a software engineer, you had to be some kind of genius, and would need some sort of a formal education for that. Clearly, that's not completely true, and I'm here today to explore this opportunity.</p>
      <p class="justify">When I actually got my hands working on some problems, It felt really good to solve them, meanwhile it was also really neat to see all the different real-world implementations of algorithms. What really excited me about this field is how fast-paced and dynamic it is. You'll become obsolete if you don't learn new things every day. This is a really great opportunity to better yourself by educating yourself and obtaining useful skills, while also learning HOW to learn in the process. This is something new to me, and it's really great. </p>
      <p class="justify">These courses were the real incentive for me to look into Front-End development specifically. Currently I don't have much experience at all, as you can see from my CV, but I believe that i posess the right mindset to reach my goal in the end. What I'm really looking forward to from this course is accelerating my progress, and having an actual curriculum to follow.</p>
      <p class="justify">Few words about this page as well, this is my first "real" page I've ever done. Hope it's not too ugly :)</p>
